## 🧠 Phase 1: The Intuition (`!HUNCH`)
**The Gap:** "Our physical signal flags (The Bamboo Telegraph) work during the day, but they are invisible at night or during heavy monsoon rains. Furthermore, the government engineers in the city remain unaware of our broken pumps for days because the news travels only as fast as the bus. The gap is the **Digital Silence** between our rural reality and urban repair resources."

## 🎨 Phase 2: The Imagination (`!SHAPE`)
**The Novel Core:**
"We will create a **'Ping-Back'** system. We turn the visual signal of a laundry-pole flag into a tiny digital 'Data Brick.' By using the one mobile phone in the village, we can bridge the gap between our physical world and the city's repair database."

**The Design:**
* **Input:** A simple "Traffic Light" interface on a cheap Android device.
* **Logic:** One-tap reporting. Red = Broken, Yellow = Failing, Green = Fixed.
* **Interoperability:** This snaps onto the existing **Bamboo Telegraph** social agreement. The flags remain for the village (Local Social), while the app serves the engineers (Global Logic).

## 🛠️ Phase 3: The Logic (`!BUILD`)
**Stability Check:**
"The application must be **Nano-sized** (< 2MB) to be shared via Bluetooth between neighbors. It must work **Offline-First**, storing the status update until the phone reaches a 2G signal area."

**Technical Specs (The "Nano-Logic"):**
1.  **State Management:** `well_status = ["Functional", "Slow", "Broken"]`
2.  **Transmission:** The system prioritizes **SMS protocol** over HTTP. SMS requires less signal strength and uses significantly less battery.
3.  **Authentication:** Only registered "Well-Guardians" recognized by the Scribe (via SIM ID) can authorize a status change to prevent false alarms.

## 🤖 Scribe Evaluation (Glass Box Logic)
> **Scribe Reasoning Log:**
> * **Hardware Mode:** CPU-Only (Optimized for low-power environments).
> * **Stability Audit:** Verified. The use of SMS as a transport layer follows the **"Host-Agnostic"** pillar by not relying on stable 4G/5G internet.
> * **Novelty Audit:** High. Bridges low-tech social signaling with high-tech data logging.
> * **Result:** **Validated.** +25 CS awarded. This Spark is now a Master Brick.

> *"The distance between a broken pump and a fixed pump is now only as wide as a single SMS."*
