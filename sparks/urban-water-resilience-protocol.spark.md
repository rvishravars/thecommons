## 1. THE SPARK - My Big Idea

### What's the problem I'm trying to solve?
Nobody can see how much water we use! My parents just tell me "stop wasting water" but I don't know if I'm actually helping. The water bill comes like two months later and by then it's too late. I can't see what my neighbors are doing either, so it feels like I'm the only one trying.

### What's my cool way of solving it?
I want to make a big scoreboard (like a video game) that shows how much water my whole block is using RIGHT NOW. It would be like a game where if everyone on my street saves water together, we all win a prize! Like a neighborhood pizza party or fixing up the park. Then saving water becomes super cool instead of just a boring rule.

## 2. THE SOUL - Why It Matters

### Who does this help?
Kids like me who want to save water but need to see it actually working. Also grown-ups on my street. And even cities who want to make sure there's enough water for everyone.

### What good thing happens?
Everyone on the street works together instead of each person trying alone. Kids learn that you can do big things when you team up. And we actually save a lot of water without people feeling like they're being punished.

## 3. THE MUSCLE - How to Build It

### How does it work? (step by step)
1. Put a special meter on the water pipe that tells us how much water the block is using RIGHT NOW
2. That meter sends the info to an app everyone on the block can see
3. The app shows "are we winning or losing?" compared to our water goal
4. If we win by the end of the month, everyone gets a prize (like the city plants new trees or we have a block party)

### What's the first thing I do?
Pick ONE street to try it on first. Get the special water meter. Build a simple app so people can see the score on their phones.

### What could go wrong?
The special meter costs a LOT of money. People might just ignore the app. The prize might not be cool enough to make people care. Some people might cheat or move away. People might still not want to work together.

## 4. THE SKIN - Does It Work?

### How do I check if it's working?
I can count how many people use the app. I can see if the water bill got smaller. I can ask neighbors if they actually talk about saving water more than before.

### What tells me I'm on the right track?
When lots of people check the app every day. When the water bill actually goes down. When my neighbors get excited and want to beat other blocks. When we hit the first prize goal!
