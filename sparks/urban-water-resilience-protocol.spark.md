## 1. ⚡ THE SPARK

### What is your core insight?
Right now, saving water is boring and invisible. You only find out if you were "bad" when a paper bill comes weeks later. My idea is to make water usage like a video game score for the whole street! If we can see how much water our block uses in real-time, we can work together to win instead of just getting in trouble alone.

### The Context (What Exists Today)
*   **Current State:** Grown-ups just say "don't water the grass" or "take shorter showers," but nobody knows if they are actually helping until it's too late. It feels like taking a test but never getting your grade back.
*   **Gap:** We can't see the water we use! It's hiding in the pipes. And we don't know if our neighbors are saving water too, so it feels like doing homework while everyone else is playing.
*   **Prior Art Tags for AI Scan:** Gamification, Kids saving the planet, Smart water meters, Teamwork.

### The Novel Core (The Delta)
The special idea is the **Neighborhood Water Scoreboard**. It's not about one house being good or bad. It's a team sport! We put a big digital sign (or an app) that shows if our street is "winning" or "losing" against the water budget. If our whole block saves enough water, we unlock cool prizes like a block party or a playground upgrade. It stops being about "rules" and starts being about "winning together."
