# Energy-Optimized CI Pipelines

---

## 🧠 Phase 1: The Spark (!HUNCH)
*Status: Active* *Scout: @rvishravars*

### The Observation
> Optimize CI for energy efficiency instead of build time.
* **The Gap:** Current defaults focus on minimizing execution time rather than energy consumption.
* **The "Why":** Energy can be measured per workflow, and slower builds might consume less power.

### Tension
* **Current Default:** Minimize execution time.
* **Alternative:** Minimize energy consumption.

### Assumptions
* Energy can be measured per workflow.
* Slower builds might use less power.

### Unknowns
* How to measure accurately?
* Trade-off with developer productivity?

### Possible Axes
* Scheduling
* Hardware selection
* Workload batching

### Maturity
* Hypothesis

## 🎨 Phase 2: The Design (!SHAPE)
*Status: Pending* *Designer: @[Handle]*

### The Novel Core (The 10% Delta)
* **The Blueprint:** (Describe the unique design of this new brick.)
* **The Interface:** (How does this "snap" into existing sparks or the root framework?)
* **Prior Art:** (Briefly list why existing solutions/bricks don't fill this gap.)



---

## 🛠️ Phase 3: The Logic (!BUILD)
*Status: In-Progress* *Builder: @[Handle]*

### Technical Implementation
* **The Logic:** (Link to the PR, code snippet, or technical documentation.)
* **Clutch Power Test:** (Explain how you verified that this brick doesn't break others.)
* **Dependencies:** (List any other Sparks or libraries required for this to function.)
