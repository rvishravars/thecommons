## 🧠 Phase 1: The Intuition (!HUNCH)
*Status: [Active]* *Scout: @Aroha_SmallScout*

### The Observation
"In our neighborhood in New Zealand, some dogs are off-leash and run fast. When they are loud or rowdy, I feel scared walking home from school. Adults say to stay calm, but I do not always know the safest path or what to do in the moment."

* **The Gap:** "There is no simple, kid-friendly way to choose a safer route or ask for help quickly when off-leash dogs appear. The gap is the **Quiet-Safe Signal** between a worried child and a calm, trusted response."
* **The "Why":** "When I feel unsafe, I stop walking and freeze. That makes me late and scared. A small, respectful signal that helps me move to safety would protect my confidence, not just my body."

## 🎨 Phase 2: The Imagination (!SHAPE)
*Status: [Pending]* *Designer: @Aroha_SmallScout*

### The Novel Core (The 10% Delta)
"We create a **Paw-Quiet Path** system that helps a child pick a calmer route and quietly alert a trusted adult without calling attention."

* **The Blueprint:** "A tiny safety card on a phone or watch with one button: `Need a safe path`."
* **The Interface:** "The app suggests a nearby calmer route using recent community reports and time-of-day patterns."
* **Prior Art:** "Existing safety apps are too loud, too complex, or assume adults are the main users."

## 🛠️ Phase 3: The Logic (!BUILD)
*Status: [In-Progress]* *Builder: @Aroha_SmallScout*

### Technical Implementation
"It must work quietly, use minimal data, and never encourage confrontation. The goal is to move away and get support, not to engage."

* **The Logic:** "One-tap check-in with an optional auto-message like: `Taking a safer route`."
* **Clutch Power Test:** "Use cached map tiles and a simple risk heatmap updated by community reports."
* **Dependencies:** "No public posting of a child location; only trusted contacts receive updates."

## 🤖 Scribe Evaluation (Glass Box Logic)
> **Scribe Reasoning Log:**
> * **Hardware Mode:** CPU-Only (Optimized for low-power environments).
> * **Stability Audit:** In progress. Needs a clear policy for report validation and privacy.
> * **Novelty Audit:** Medium. Combines route guidance with gentle safety check-ins.
> * **Result:** **Provisional.** Recommend pilot with school safety group.
