## 🧠 Phase 1: The Intuition (`!HUNCH`)
**The Observation:** "In our neighborhood in New Zealand, some dogs are off-leash and run fast. When they are loud or rowdy, I feel scared walking home from school. Adults say to stay calm, but I do not always know the safest path or what to do in the moment."

**The Gap:** "There is no simple, kid-friendly way to choose a safer route or ask for help quickly when off-leash dogs appear. The gap is the **Quiet-Safe Signal** between a worried child and a calm, trusted response."

**The "Why":** "When I feel unsafe, I stop walking and freeze. That makes me late and scared. A small, respectful signal that helps me move to safety would protect my confidence, not just my body."

## 🎨 Phase 2: The Imagination (`!SHAPE`)
**The Novel Core:**
"We create a **Paw-Quiet Path** system that helps a child pick a calmer route and quietly alert a trusted adult without calling attention."

**The Design:**
* **Input:** A simple button on a phone or watch: `Need a safe path`.
* **Logic:** The app suggests a nearby calmer route using recent community reports and time-of-day patterns.
* **Interoperability:** It sends a gentle check-in to a trusted contact or school buddy so someone knows the child is changing route.

## 🛠️ Phase 3: The Logic (`!BUILD`)
**Stability Check:**
"It must work quietly, use minimal data, and never encourage confrontation. The goal is to move away and get support, not to engage."

**Technical Specs (The "Nano-Logic"):**
1. **Signal:** One-tap check-in with an optional auto-message like: `Taking a safer route.`
2. **Route:** Use cached map tiles and a simple risk heatmap updated by community reports.
3. **Privacy:** No public posting of a child location; only trusted contacts receive updates.

## 🤖 Scribe Evaluation (Glass Box Logic)
> **Scribe Reasoning Log:**
> * **Hardware Mode:** CPU-Only (Optimized for low-power environments).
> * **Stability Audit:** In progress. Needs a clear policy for report validation and privacy.
> * **Novelty Audit:** Medium. Combines route guidance with gentle safety check-ins.
> * **Result:** **Provisional.** Recommend pilot with school safety group.
