# Dynamic Infrastructure-Linked Zoning to Improve Housing Affordability

# 1. Spark Narrative
What if zoning density automatically increased when local infrastructure capacity
(water, transport, energy) exceeded defined utilization thresholds?

Zoning adjustments are episodic, politically mediated, and not systematically tied to real-time infrastructure capacity.

This could reduce bureaucratic lag and allow supply to respond faster to demand.

# 2. Hypothesis Formalization
**Hypothesis Statement**
> Regions using infrastructure-triggered zoning adjustments will increase annual housing supply by at least 10% compared to static zoning regions.

**Null Hypothesis**
> Dynamic zoning adjustments produce no statistically significant change in housing supply.

# 3. Simulation / Modeling Plan
## Model Type
Agent-based urban development simulation using historical permit and infrastructure data.

## Inputs
- Historical building consent data
- Infrastructure capacity metrics
- Population growth data

## Expected Outputs
- Housing supply growth curves
- Infrastructure utilization trajectories
- Price trend projections

## Sensitivity Analysis
- Population growth variability
- Developer response elasticity
- Infrastructure expansion timing

---

# 4. Evaluation Strategy
Compare:
- Regions with simulated dynamic zoning
vs
- Historical baseline performance

---

# 5. Feedback & Critique
## Hidden Assumptions
- Infrastructure capacity data is reliable.
- Developers act immediately on density incentives.

## Counter-Hypothesis
> Infrastructure constraints are not the main limiting factor; land speculation and construction labor shortages dominate.
