# Contributing to TheCommons

Welcome! TheCommons thrives on collaboration, open ideas, and community contributions. We're excited to have you help expand and improve this lightweight, Git-backed framework.

## Our Philosophy

TheCommons is built on principles of:
- **Lightweight Design**: Keep it simple, fast, and easy to understand
- **Git-Backed**: All content and data live in Git repositories
- **Open Collaboration**: Ideas are shared, discussed, and refined together
- **Framework Expansion**: Help us grow the capabilities and reach of the platform

## How to Contribute
