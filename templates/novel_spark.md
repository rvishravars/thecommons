## 🧠 Phase 1: The Spark (!HUNCH)
*Status: [Active / Claimed]* *Scout: @[YourGitHubHandle]*

### The Observation
> Use your spark here. What is missing? What feels "off" in the current ecosystem?
* **The Gap:** (e.g., "Our current notification system is too noisy.")
* **The "Why":** (e.g., "Users are ignoring important alerts because of minor update pings.")

## 🎨 Phase 2: The Design (!SHAPE)
*Status: [Pending / Designed]* *Designer: @[Handle]*

### The Novel Core (The 10% Delta)
* **The Blueprint:** (Describe the unique design of this new brick.)
* **The Interface:** (How does this "snap" into existing sparks or the root framework?)
* **Prior Art:** (Briefly list why existing solutions/bricks don't fill this gap.)



---

## 🛠️ Phase 3: The Logic (!BUILD)
*Status: [In-Progress / Merged]* *Builder: @[Handle]*

### Technical Implementation
* **The Logic:** (Link to the PR, code snippet, or technical documentation.)
* **Clutch Power Test:** (Explain how you verified that this brick doesn't break others.)
* **Dependencies:** (List any other Sparks or libraries required for this to function.)
