# ⚡ Novel Spark Template: Defining the Delta

## 1. The Spark Title
*Short, descriptive name for your idea.*

## 2. The Context (The Wheel)
*What exists today? List the current solutions, libraries, or methodologies that address this problem. Why are they insufficient?*

## 3. The Novel Core (The Delta) 
*This is the most important section. What is the specific 'tweak,' 'pivot,' or 'breakthrough' that makes your version unique? Describe the logic that differentiates this from the 'Wheel' described above.*

## 4. Technical Spec / Human Logic
*How does it work? Provide step-by-step instructions or a technical overview of the execution.*

## 5. Potential Critical Flaws
*Self-audit: What are the biggest risks or reasons this might fail? (Identifying these early earns respect from Refiners).*

## 6. Verification Method
*How will the community know when the 'Delta' has been successfully executed? Define a clear "Definition of Done."*
