# 1. Spark Narrative
<!-- Describe the idea clearly and compellingly.
     Explain the shift in thinking.
     What makes this different from current approaches? -->

---

# 2. Hypothesis Formalization
<!-- Convert the spark into a falsifiable statement. -->

**Hypothesis Statement**
> "<Clear measurable hypothesis>"

**Null Hypothesis**
> "<What would prove this wrong?>"

---

# 3. Simulation / Modeling Plan
<!-- Describe how the idea will be tested before full implementation. -->

## Model Type
- <Data replay / mathematical model / agent-based simulation / prototype / other>

## Inputs
- <Data or parameters required>

## Expected Outputs
- <What results will be generated?>

## Sensitivity Analysis
- <What variables may significantly change outcomes?>

---

# 4. Evaluation Strategy
<!-- Define how evidence will be gathered and judged. -->

- Measurement method:
- Data source:
- Statistical or logical criteria:
- Comparison baseline:

---

# 5. Feedback & Critique
