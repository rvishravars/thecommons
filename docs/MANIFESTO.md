# 📜 TheCommons: Master Framework (v2.0)

---

## Part 1: The Manifesto

### 1. The Trinity of the Build
TheCommons is a modular meritocracy. Like LEGO, we do not value isolated ideas; we value **"Clutch Power"**—the ability for a contribution to snap into the existing structure and hold firm. Every contribution is categorized by its "Chemistry":

* **1.1 🧠 Intuition (The Scout):** The "gut feel." Identifying a gap, a flaw, or a future need. This is the **Signal**.
* **1.2 🎨 Imagination (The Designer):** The "leap." Visualizing the solution and defining the **Novel Core** (the 10% delta). This is the **Blueprint**.
* **1.3 🛠️ Logic (The Builder):** The "rigor." Engineering, coding, and stress-testing the solution. This is the **Clutch Power**.

### 2. Governance: The Republic of Bricks
Influence is earned through tangible value. The system is designed to reward the "Chain of Value" from the first hunch to the final code.

#### 2.1 The Value Hierarchy
| Element | Role | Reward | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🧠 Intuition** | **Scout** | +5 CS | **Discovery:** Identifying "Loose Studs" or gaps in the ecosystem. |
| **🎨 Imagination** | **Designer** | +15 CS | **Invention:** Defining a "Novel Core" and drafting a buildable blueprint. |
| **🛠️ Logic** | **Builder** | +25 CS | **Execution:** Proving the idea works with merged, functional code. |
| **🏛️ Structure** | **Architect** | +50 CS | **Foundation:** Proposing structural amendments to this Manifesto. |

#### 2.2 The "Snap" Multipliers
* **The Echo Bonus:** If a Scout’s `!HUNCH` is officially "claimed" by a Designer, the Scout receives an additional **+5 CS**.
* **The Prototype Bonus:** If a Designer’s `!SHAPE` is successfully translated into a working MVP by a Builder, the Designer receives **+10 CS**.
* **The Stability Audit:** A Builder earns **+10 CS** for identifying a logic flaw in a merged Spark and providing a stabilizing patch.

#### 2.3 Logarithmic Voting Power
To prevent "Whale Dictatorship," influence scales non-linearly:
$$Weight = log_{10}(CS)$$
* **Sybil Protection:** Voting rights are restricted to contributors with **CS > 20** or **3 merged actions**.

### 3. The Scribe: Distributed Intelligence
The AI Scribe is the **Instruction Manual**, not the Master Builder.
* **3.1 Frugal Compute:** The Scribe utilizes low-cost "Mini-Models" for basic checks and a community-powered **DePIN Grid** for heavy logic audits to ensure zero cost-barriers.
* **3.2 The Standard Gauge:** The Scribe’s primary function is **Compatibility Verification**—ensuring every new "brick" adheres to the Commons technical standards.

### 4. Conflict & Dispute Resolution (The Logic Audit)
* **4.1 The Challenge:** Contributors may file a `!CHALLENGE` if they believe a Spark lacks Logic (it's "wobbly") or Imagination (it's a duplicate brick).
* **4.2 The Cooling Rack:** If a Spark receives >5 critical flaws in 24 hours, the AI locks the thread for 12 hours to prevent dogpiling and allow the Builder to apply "Clutch Power" (fixes).

## 🏛️ Theoretical Foundation

TheCommons is built upon decades of research into decentralized cooperation, institutional economics, and stigmergic systems. Our "LEGO" model is a practical implementation of the following academic pillars:

### 1. The Governance of the Commons
Based on the work of Nobel Laureate **Elinor Ostrom** (*Governing the Commons*, 1990).
* **The Principle:** Successful common-pool resources require "graduated sanctions" and "collective-choice arrangements."
* **Application:** Our **Manifesto** serves as the constitutional layer, while the **AI Scribe** acts as the automated monitor to ensure the "Bricks" meet community standards.

### 2. Commons-Based Peer Production (CBPP)
Based on the theories of **Yochai Benkler** (*The Wealth of Networks*, 2006).
* **The Principle:** CBPP succeeds when tasks are broken down into **Granular** and **Modular** components.
* **Application:** The **Intuition → Imagination → Logic** trinity allows for "low-friction entry," where a Scout can contribute a small Hunch without needing the technical Logic to build the entire system.

### 3. Stigmergic Coordination
Based on the research of **Mark Elliott** (*Stigmergic Collaboration*, 2016).
* **The Principle:** Agents coordinate by leaving "traces" in the environment that stimulate further action (e.g., how ants follow pheromone trails).
* **Application:** Every `!HUNCH` or `!SHAPE` left in the `/sparks/` directory is a digital pheromone. The environment (the repo) directs the community's energy without the need for central management.

### 4. Non-Linear Influence & Meritocracy
Based on **Logarithmic Scaling** and **Plural Control** theories (**Glen Weyl et al.**).
* **The Principle:** To prevent "Whale Dictatorship" in decentralized systems, voting power should not scale linearly with capital or points.
* **Application:** We implement $$Weight = log_{10}(CS)$$ to ensure that while high-contributors (Architects) have more say, they cannot easily silence the collective "Intuition" of the Scouts.

### 5. Open-Source Translucence
Based on **Dabbish et al.** (*Social Translucence in GitHub*, 2012).
* **The Principle:** Deep transparency in contribution history drives trust and attracts high-quality "Builders."
* **Application:** **"Execution is the Moat"**—by making all Logic audits and Contribution Scores public, we create a high-trust environment where the most capable actors naturally rise to the top.

## Part 2: Getting Started Guide

### 1. Level 1: Use your Intuition (+5 CS)
Browse the repository or the current `/sparks/`. Find a "Loose Stud"—a typo, a broken link, or a missing feature. 
* **Action:** Submit via `!HUNCH [Description]`.
* **Goal:** Provide the "Signal" for others to build upon.

### 2. Level 2: Use your Imagination (+15 CS)
Take a Hunch and give it a shape. You don't need to code yet, but you must define the **Novel Core**.
1.  Use `!SHAPE [Blueprint Name]`.
2.  Define how this brick "snaps" into existing ones.
3.  Defend the design against "Logic" critiques to secure your points.

### 3. Level 3: Apply your Logic (+25 CS)
The heaviest lift. Turn a Blueprint into a functional reality.
1.  Write the code/logic for a pending `!SHAPE`.
2.  Submit a Pull Request (PR) to the `/sparks/` directory.
3.  Once the **Standard Gauge** (AI) and a Peer review pass, your brick is merged.

## Part 3: The Development Roadmap

* [x] **Manifesto v2.0:** Integrated LEGO-style meritocracy (Intuition/Imagination/Logic).
* [ ] **The DePIN Grid:** Set up the community-powered GPU node for the Scribe.
* [ ] **The "Snap" Bot:** Automate the multi-role reward system (Echo & Prototype bonuses).
* [ ] **Modular Spark Template:** Create the `!SHAPE` markdown template for Designers.
