## The Architecture of Your Idea

Your idea isn't a static statue to be guarded; it's a living organism that thrives through collaborative construction. This template guides you through the anatomy every impactful idea needs to evolve from a solitary spark into a robust, collective reality.

---

## 1. ⚡ THE SPARK
*The initial flash of brilliance—your "Aha!" moment when two disparate thoughts collided to create something new.*

### What is your core insight?
*In 2-3 sentences, capture the essence of your breakthrough. What collision of ideas sparked this vision?*

### The Context (What Exists Today)
*What current solutions, libraries, or methodologies address this problem space? Why are they insufficient?*
* **Prior Art Tags for AI Scan:** [List 3-5 specific keywords here]

### The Novel Core (The Delta)
*This is the most critical section. What is the specific 'tweak,' 'pivot,' or 'breakthrough' that makes your version unique? Describe the logic that differentiates this from existing approaches.*

**✨ Activation:** Document your spark immediately. Don't let the electricity dissipate. This template is your anchor.

---

## 2. 💫 THE SOUL (Your Manifesto)
*If the spark is the collision, the Soul is the meaning you give it. This isn't a business plan—it's a declaration of intent.*

### Why does this matter?
* **What problem does it solve?**
* **What value does it create?**
* **What future does it envision?**

### Guiding Principles
*What are the 2-3 core values or principles that will guide this idea's evolution? (e.g., openness, accessibility, sustainability)*

**✨ Activation:** Your manifesto gives your idea emotional weight and direction. When things get tough, this is what keeps you and the community aligned.

---

## 3. 💪 THE MUSCLE (First Steps)
*With a soul established, your idea needs to move. The Muscle represents the initial, tangible actions that translate vision into reality.*

### Technical Spec / Human Logic
*How does it work? Provide step-by-step instructions, a logic flow, or a technical overview of the execution.*

### First Actionable Steps
*What are the 3-5 smallest, most concrete tasks that can be taken immediately?*
1. 
2. 
3. 

### Self-Audit: Potential Critical Flaws
*What are the biggest risks or reasons this might fail? (Identifying these early earns respect from Refiners and strengthens your idea.)*

**✨ Activation:** Focus on the absolute minimum viable movement. Muscle is built through tension and repetition. Your idea needs to move to gain strength.

---

## 4. 🛡️ THE SKIN (Feedback Loop)
*The Skin is where your idea interacts with the outside world. It's the constant flow of feedback, observation, and learning that allows your idea to adapt, evolve, and grow.*

### How will you gather feedback?
*What mechanisms will you use to collect community input? (e.g., GitHub issues, discussions, surveys, office hours)*

### Success Metrics (Definition of Done)
*How will the community know when the 'Delta' has been successfully executed? Define the specific criteria required to claim the +30 CS Implementation Bonus.*

### Evolution Indicators
*What signals will tell you the idea is maturing and adapting successfully?*

**✨ Activation:** Embrace the feedback loop. Share your idea (even in its raw form) with trusted peers. Every interaction strengthens its outer layer and resilience.

## 📋 Instructions for the Originator

**Remember:** You don't need a perfect plan; you need an anatomy.

1. **Fill out this template:** Ensure all four elements (Spark, Soul, Muscle, Skin) are clearly defined.
2. **Create a new file:** Save your completed template as a `.md` file inside the `/sparks/` directory (e.g., `/sparks/your-idea-name.md`).
3. **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Open a PR from your branch to the main repository.
4. **Initiate the Audit:** Comment `!SPARK` on your own PR. This notifies the AI Scribe to generate a Novelty Report and alerts the community Refiners to begin their audit.

**Structure Creates Freedom:** By documenting your idea's anatomy, you invite collaborative construction that turns fragile sparks into resilient realities.
