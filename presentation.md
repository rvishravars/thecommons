## Master Framework (v1.6)
### *For the Inventors.*

## 🌍 The Mission

**The Republic of Doers**

We honor the silent inventor by becoming the vocal executor.
Transparency is the only law. Execution is the only moat.

---

## 1. The Prime Directive

**Novelty & Transparency**

*   We do not reward "re-inventing the wheel".
*   We reward the **Delta**: The measurable difference between the status quo and the new idea.

---

## 🏛️ Core Pillars

1.  **Radical Transparency:** Everything is public from Day 1.
2.  **Execution is the Moat:** Speed and quality of execution > The Idea itself.
3.  **Glass Box AI:** Governance AI must be open-source.
4.  **The Living Spark:** Sparks are living documents (Wiki Protocol).
5.  **Host-Agnostic:** Data belongs to the community (Migration pre-authorized).

## ⚖️ Governance: The Value Hierarchy

Influence is earned through tangible value via Contribution Score (CS).

| Role | Reward | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🧹 Janitor** | +2 CS | Maintenance (Typos, Links) |
| **🛠️ Refiner** | +10 CS | Hardening (Finding Flaws) |
| **⚡ Spark** | +25 CS | Invention (Unique Insight) |
| **🏛️ Architect** | +50 CS | Structural Amendments |

## ⚡ The Spark: Defining the Novel Core

*   **The Delta Lock:** Originators must explicitly define the "Novel Core" (the 10% that is new).
*   **Living Document:** Stored in `/sparks/` and subject to continuous refinement.
*   **Proof of Delta:** Withstand 3 Refiner critiques to earn full points.
*   **Implementation Bonus:** +30 CS for a working MVP.

---

## 🗳️ Voting: Anti-Whale Logic

To prevent dictatorship, voting power is logarithmic.

$$Weight = log_{10}(CS)$$

*   **Sybil Protection:** Voting restricted to contributors with > 3 PRs or > 50 CS.
*   **Supermajority:** 75% required for Manifesto changes.

---

## 🛡️ Conflict Resolution: The Novelty Audit

*   **!CHALLENGE:** Any user (>10 CS) can challenge a Spark's novelty.
*   **The Investigator:** AI Scribe generates a "Novelty Report" scanning prior art.
*   **The Jury:** 3 Randomly selected contributors (>50 CS) decide.

---

## 🗺️ Development Roadmap

*   [x] **Manifesto v1.6:** Governance & Rewards
*   [ ] **Novelty Scan Script:** AI Prior Art Discovery
*   [ ] **CS Tracker Bot:** GitHub Actions for Points
*   [ ] **The Midnight Scribe:** Auto-patch generation
*   [ ] **Succession Protocol:** Decentralized Verification
